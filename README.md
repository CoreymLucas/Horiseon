# Code Refactor Starter Code

For this project I was given starter code from Horiseon to refactor.
I added comments for each html section.
I added a more descriptive tile.
I fixed the "search engine optimization" nav bar by adding an id.
I added alt attributes to all images.
I added comments to each css section.
